# TestRail QA Setup Guide

This repository provides a comprehensive TestRail setup guide, featuring intensive test cases, Playwright automation on https://demo.opencart.com, risk-based testing, test coverage, and reporting. It showcases my 9+ years of QA experience at companies like Unity Technologies and ServiceTitan. Mock TestRail API calls are used for demonstration without requiring a TestRail account.
