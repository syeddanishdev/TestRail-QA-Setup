# TestRail Best Practices

- **Naming Conventions**: Use prefixes (e.g., "TC001_Login_Valid").
- **Modular Suites**: Limit suites to ~100 test cases.
- **Automation**: Use Playwright for UI, performance, and security tests on https://demo.opencart.com (see [scripts/](../scripts/)).
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Prioritize high-risk cases (see [risk-assessment.md](../docs/risk-assessment.md)).
- **Coverage**: Map test cases to requirements (see [test-coverage.md](../docs/test-coverage.md)).
- **Reporting**: Generate stakeholder-ready reports (see [reporting.md](../docs/reporting.md)).
