# Risk Assessment and Matrix for TestRail Testing

Risk-based testing ensures critical functionalities are prioritized based on impact and likelihood.

## Risk Assessment Process
1. **Identify Risks**: Analyze requirements and critical paths (e.g., payment processing).
2. **Evaluate Impact**: Consider business impact (revenue loss, user trust).
3. **Assess Likelihood**: Evaluate defect history, code complexity, and change frequency.
4. **Prioritize Testing**: Use the risk matrix to focus on high-risk areas.
5. **Integrate with TestRail**: Add custom field "Risk_Level" (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

## Risk Matrix
| **Likelihood / Impact** | **Low Impact** | **Medium Impact** | **High Impact** |
|--------------------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **High Likelihood**      | Medium         | High              | Critical        |
| **Medium Likelihood**    | Low            | Medium            | High            |
| **Low Likelihood**       | Low            | Low               | Medium          |

## Example Application
For an e-commerce app:
- **Payment Failure (Critical)**: High impact (revenue loss), high likelihood (complex integrations). Test exhaustively.
- **Login Failure (High)**: High impact (blocks access), medium likelihood (stable module). Test thoroughly.
- **UI Misalignment (Low)**: Low impact (aesthetic), low likelihood (static). Test minimally.

## Implementation in TestRail
- Add "Risk_Level" field in **Administration > Customizations**.
- Assign risk levels to test cases (e.g., "TC004_Payment_Success" = Critical).
- Filter test runs by risk level to prioritize execution.
