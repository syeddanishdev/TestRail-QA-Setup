# Reporting in TestRail

TestRailâ€™s reporting provides insights into test progress, coverage, and defects for stakeholders.

## Reporting Strategy
1. **Define Report Goals**:
   - **Progress**: Track execution status (e.g., % completed).
   - **Coverage**: Ensure requirements and configurations are tested.
   - **Defects**: Analyze trends and resolution times.
2. **Key Reports**:
   - **Test Run Summary**: Shows passed/failed/blocked tests.
   - **Coverage Report**: Maps test cases to requirements/configurations.
   - **Defect Trend Report**: Tracks defects, integrated with Jira.
   - **Milestone Progress**: Monitors testing against release goals.
3. **Customization**:
   - Filter by tester, suite, or risk level.
   - Add custom fields (e.g., "Risk_Level") for insights.
4. **Stakeholder Communication**:
   - Export reports as PDF/CSV for sharing.
   - Use dashboards for real-time tracking.

## Implementation in TestRail
- Generate reports in **Reports** tab.
- Example: "Coverage Report" for "Payment Suite" to confirm 100% critical flow coverage.
- Schedule weekly reports in **Administration > Reports**.
- Integrate with Jira for defect data.

## Example Reports
- **Test Run Summary**: 85% tests passed, 10% failed, 5% blocked for "Version 1.0."
- **Coverage Report**: 100% requirement coverage for "Login," 90% for "Checkout."
- **Defect Trend**: 12 new defects in payment, 10 resolved within 24 hours.
