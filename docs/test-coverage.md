# Test Coverage Strategy for TestRail

Test coverage ensures all critical functionalities are tested, reducing production defects.

## Coverage Approach
1. **Requirement Mapping**:
   - Map test cases to user stories in TestRail using custom fields (e.g., "Story_ID").
   - Example: Link "TC001_Login_ValidCredentials" to "US-101: User Login."
2. **Coverage Types**:
   - **Functional**: Test all user flows (e.g., login, payment).
   - **Edge Cases**: Test boundaries (e.g., max cart items).
   - **Performance**: Test under load (e.g., 1000 concurrent checkouts).
   - **Security**: Test vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS in login).
3. **Coverage Metrics**:
   - **Requirement Coverage**: Ensure 100% of critical requirements are tested.
   - **Configuration Coverage**: Test across browsers/devices (Chrome, Firefox, iOS).
   - **Code Coverage**: Use Playwright with tools like Istanbul for UI coverage.
4. **TestRail Implementation**:
   - Track coverage in **Test Suites & Cases**.
   - Use custom field "Requirement_ID" to link test cases.
   - Generate coverage reports in **Reports** tab.

## Example
For an e-commerce app[](https://demo.opencart.com):
- **Login Module**:
  - Requirements: US-101 (Login), US-102 (Password Reset).
  - Test Cases: TC001-TC003 (100% requirement coverage).
  - Configurations: Chrome, Firefox (100% browser coverage).
- **Payment Module**:
  - Requirements: US-201 (Checkout Payment).
  - Test Cases: TC004-TC007 (100% critical flows, 80% edge cases).
  - Performance: Test checkout under load.
